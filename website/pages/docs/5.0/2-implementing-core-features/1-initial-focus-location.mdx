#### Initial focus location

The focused location isn't set up by default. You can enable it by setting the `initialFocusLocation` property in the `ReactGrid` component.


Example:

```tsx
<ReactGrid
  cells={cells}
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  initialFocusLocation={{ rowIndex: 2, colIndex: 1 }}
/>
```
